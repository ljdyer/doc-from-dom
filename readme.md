# dom2doc

dom2doc is a browser extension for Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox that lets you download text from the DOM elements that you specify as a Word file.

It was developed for and is currently used by a team of translators whose daily work includes extracting text from specific parts of pages on certain browser-based systems.

## How to use
